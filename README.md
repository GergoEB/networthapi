# SkyHelper API
A hypixel skyblock API wrapper containing most features that the [SkyHelper](https://top.gg/bot/710143953533403226) bot has to offer.

This API was made using the [Hypixel Skyblock Facade](https://github.com/Senither/hypixel-skyblock-facade) and [SkyCrypt](https://github.com/SkyCryptWebsite/SkyCrypt).

# Installing

### Requirements:

Node.js >= 14

### Setup:

1. Clone the repository using
`git clone https://github.com/Altpapier/SkyHelperAPI.git`

2. Install all dependencies using NPM by going into the `SkyHelperAPI` folder
`npm install`

3. Start the API using `node .` or `npm start`

### Environment Variables
The Port normally defaults to `3000`. If you want to change that, you can do so by changing the `PORT` environment variable.

You will have to set the Hypixel API key by adding the `HYPIXEL_API_KEY` environment variable.

To be able to use the API you will need to define your own API keys. For that add the `TOKENS` environment variable and add tokens seperated by a `,`
Example: `token1,token2`

The API automatically updates upon starting. If you wish to not want that, change the `AUTO_UPDATE` environment variable to `false`
